# Wall-1
*This is the source code of my wall-1 discord bot. You can see the project page <a href='http://main.st4lwolf.org/projects/wall-1/index.html'>here.</a>*

**Versions:**   
the different versions are represented by the folders at the root of the github branch. For example, to get the complete code of version 1.3, you need to 
access the `automod_v1.3` folder. 

**File information:**   
When you access the directory for a release, there are several files. The file with the `.py` extension (in the above example `automod_v1.3.py`) is 
simply the complete wall-1 code. Please note that if you wish to use it and/or modify the code, you must enter your discord bot token in the .env file. You can simply get it on discord developer portal.     

**`requirements.txt`.**
This one is mainly used to tell your hosting service which python libraries to install. In this case, wall-1 uses manies pyton libraries, so we can install it by using this file.
